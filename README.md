final assignment
## Project Overview
This project is a multi-page website created for the high-fidelity wireframe protfolio website that I design in UX experience class , a digital content creation protfolio specializing in camera works. not all the design and image are follow in this assignment because some of the stock images are replace with my own image. The website consists of three main pages: Home, Works, and Contact. The site is designed to be responsive and accessible, leveraging the Bootstrap framework along with custom CSS to create a visually appealing and functional user experience.

## Process
### Planning
The project began with a detailed analysis of the wireframes provided, followed by the creation of a new GitHub repository named `mtm6201_final`. The wireframes were stored in an `images` folder as required. I ensured that the structure of the project adhered to best practices in naming conventions, file organization, and overall design consistency.

### Development
I utilized the Bootstrap framework to handle the grid system, components, and utilities, try ensuring a responsive design. Custom CSS variables were used to adjust the default Bootstrap color scheme to match the design requirements. I also incorporated a publicly available CSS library, [Animate.css](https://animate.style/), to add subtle animations to various elements on the website.

During development, I focused on creating a clean and organized codebase. Semantic HTML5 elements were used to improve accessibility, and ARIA roles were added where appropriate. The images used on the site were optimized for different screen sizes and loaded using the `<picture>` tag with `srcset` to ensure the best performance across devices.

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Responsive Design:** Trying my best to ensuring the site was fully responsive across a wide range of screen sizes was challenging. I utilized Bootstrap's grid system and media queries to address this, testing the site across various devices to fine-tune the layout.

2. **Accessibility Compliance:** Implementing ARIA roles, ensuring proper contrast, and providing alternative text for images required careful consideration. I used tools like Lighthouse and WAVE to audit the site for accessibility and made necessary adjustments based on the feedback.

3. **Overlaying Text on Images:** Positioning text over images while maintaining responsiveness was initially tricky. By using a combination of Bootstrap's utility classes and custom CSS, I was able to achieve a solution that works well across devices.

4. **Image Optimization:** Balancing image quality with load times was a challenge. I used the `<picture>` tag along with optimized image formats and sizes to ensure that images were clear without negatively impacting performance.

### Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I almost forgot how to write code after I finish other class Final assignments and back to this, it took a while to remeber some of the lessons, till I don't think I not able to get it all. However, I have a deeper understanding of responsive web design principles and accessibility standards. I also improved my ability to work with Bootstrap and learned how to effectively use CSS variables to customize default themes. Additionally, I gained experience in optimizing images for the web and using the `<picture>` tag to enhance performance and responsiveness.

## Final Thoughts
